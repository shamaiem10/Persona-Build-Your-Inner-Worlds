# 🧠 Persona– Build Your Inner Worlds

**Persona** is a whimsical-meets-functional web app made for the **CS Girlies "AI vs HI" Hackathon** under the theme:  
**“Make anything. But make it you.”**

Built for the dreamers, overthinkers, and multi-dimensional girlies who carry an entire group chat in their head — this app helps you **create, express, and chat with your inner personas** in one beautiful space.

- 🧠 Journal from their perspective.
- ✅ Set personal goals for each one.
- 💬 Group chat between your personas — like a personal inner WhatsApp.
- 🖼️ Cute UI with side tabs, pastel palette, and smooth experience.
